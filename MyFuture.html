            <h2>Future Highschool:</h2>
        <p>I would love to attend Millikan High School and be apart of their Quest program. I am really wanting the challenge of taking AP classes for college credits. Millikan also has an atmosphere I really think would work for the type of learning I need to be successful. Moreover, their surf and dance team are both exceptional so I would love to be able to be able to be apart of those teams as well.</p>

        <h2>College:</h2>
        <p>My goal for college is to attend a prestigious school like Yale, Harvard, West Point, or Annapolis the Naval Academy. Yale and Harvard both have amazing law programs and have graduated some of our U.S presidents. Over the summer I got the oppurtunity to visit both these amazing colleges and I fell in love with both of Yale's and Harvard's campus! West Point and Annapolis are the most structured advanced military universities that would be an option to push my academic and physical strength to the next level to become a Navy Seal or EOD one day. I would love to graduate any of those colleges with a Doctorate degree.</p>

    <h2>Career Interests:</h2>
<p>My career interests consists of becoming an FBI agent, running for President of the U.S.A, or joining the Navy. If I decided to work in politics I would want to become a lawyer or judge in the Supreme court. Then maybe, have a party support me and run for the president of the United States. I am also interested in joining the Navy since I am in the military family and becoming a Seal or EOD(Explosive Ordance Disposal).

    <h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>My goal is to inspire other young girls that they can do anything they believe in and that indivuality is very important! As I grow old I want to live a humble life and practice having good faith. My dream is to live in a very nice home on the beach, with my dream dog (German Shepard). I also want to then settle down and travel the world with someone who loves me as much I love them. </p><article>
