            <h2>Future Highschool:</h2>
        <p>I would like to attend Millikan High School and be a part of their Quest program. I would appreciate the challenging curriculum and the oppurtunity to take AP classes throughout high school with the possibility to recieve college credits. This program also provides a learning environment that compliments my future academic endeavors. Additionally, their surf and dance teams are both exceptional and I would be intrested in participating in both.</p>

        <h2>College:</h2>
        <p>My goal for college is to attend a prestigious school such as Yale, Harvard, West Point, or Annapolis the Naval Academy. Yale and Harvard both have amazing political science programs and have graduated some of our formor U.S Presidents. Over the summer I got the oppurtunity to visit both of these amazing colleges. I fell in love with both campuses! I am also considering advanced military academies, such as West Point and Annapolis because of the academic and physical training. It is my long term academic goal to recieve a Doctorate degree.</p>

<p>My career interests include joining the Navy and working in a law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and CIA. Specifically, I would want to train to become a Navy Seal or EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal).I am also interested in politics and would consider becoming an attorney.

    <h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>My goal is to inspire other young girls that they can do anything they believe in and that indivuality is very important! As I grow old I want to live a humble life and practice having good faith. My dream is to live in a very nice home on the beach, with my dream dog (German Shepard). I also want to then settle down and travel the world with someone who loves me as much I love them. </p><article>
