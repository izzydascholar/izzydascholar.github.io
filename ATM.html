            <h2>Favorite Project:</h2>
        <p> Working in Illustrator was one of my favorite projects. I loved creating a website and being challenged to learn a new program on the computers. It was also very cool to be able to bring dance something I love into a school project.</p>

    <h2>Reflection of Website:</h2>
<p>The ATM program has given me an opportunity and platform to learn and explore in detail different technology skills. This program has helped me excel in my other classes when I am asked to do something on the computers. Also, being able to type well has helped me get other assignments like essays done faster. We have also been able to explore jobs in the technology field. I am so glad I picked ATM as my elective at Bancroft Middle School for my three years here.    </p>
