            <h2>Favorite Project:</h2>
        <p>This assignment was to create a webpage that people could view what skills I have learned about when coding a website using css and html. This project was so cool because it was nice to see myself understanding a hard concept and showing off my skills. This project was very independant and I love challenging myself and having to use my resources to figure things out so I thought this project was very exciting! One difficult thing was finding my own little mistakes. In code even if one tag is misspelled or not closed your information will not show up. In all, I have been enjoying this unit of learning to create websites so much and I can't wait to enhance my skills even more!</p>

    <h2>Reflection of Website:</h2>
<p>The ATM program has given me an opportunity and platform to learn and explore in detail different technology skills. This program has helped me excel in my other classes when I am asked to do something on the computers. Also, being able to type well has helped me get other assignments like essays done faster. We have also been able to explore jobs in the technology field. I am so glad I picked ATM as my elective at Bancroft Middle School for my three years here.    </p>
