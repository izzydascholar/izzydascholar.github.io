            <h2>Favorite Project:</h2>
        <p> This is a magazine cover I created in Illustrator in seventh grade. We learned how to use all the tools in the software and applied it to make an amazing cover for a fake magazine. This was one of my favorite projects because I was able to apply my favorite thing which is dance to a school project. I am so proud of this magazine cover because Mrs.McClure printed it out and put it up on the wall as a good example. Adding on, I really put my best effort into this project and spent alot of time making sure it would come out perfect. Learning a whole new software to create this was difficult and learning how to properly use the tools was tough but in the end it was such a fun and engaging project that I really admired!</p>

    <h2>Reflection of Website:</h2>
<p>The ATM program has given me an opportunity and platform to learn and explore in detail different technology skills. This program has helped me excel in my other classes when I am asked to do something on the computers. Also, being able to type well has helped me get other assignments like essays done faster. We have also been able to explore jobs in the technology field. I am so glad I picked ATM as my elective at Bancroft Middle School for my three years here.    </p>
