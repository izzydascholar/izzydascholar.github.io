            <h2>Family Life:</h2>
        <p>I live with my mom, dad, little sister, dog and cats. My mom is a psychologist in the FBI and my dad is an architect. Together my parents are both so educated and amazing in every way. Let's not forget about my little sister, hands downs she is my best friend and twin all in one. She is so funny and I would do anything for her! My family life at home is so supportive, loving and caring. They have all helped me overcome so many things and I love them so much words could never explain.</p>

        <h2>Skills:</h2>
    <p>Some skills I have are using photoshop, coding, and editing footage using IMovie on the computers. I am a very good student which has led me to have a 4.0 GPA since sixth grade. I am also a very avid writer in ELA. I love to dance and run as well. Another skill I have is having good time management and staying organized.  I am also very good at having patience with people who need help with something!</p>
