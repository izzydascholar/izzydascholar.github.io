            <h2>Family Life:</h2>
        <p> I live with my mom, dad, little sister and my dog and cats. My mom is psychologist in the FBI and my dad is a architect. Together they are both so educated and fantastic parents. My little sister hands downs is my best friend and twin all in one, she is so funny and I would do anything for her. My family life at home is so supportive, loving and caring. They have helped me overcome so many things and I love them so much words could not explain. </p>
